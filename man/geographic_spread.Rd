\usage{
geographic_spread(years = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{years}{a vector of years to retrieve data for (i.e. \code{2014} for CDC
flu season 2014-2015). CDC has data for this API going back to 2003
and up until the current, active flu season.
Default value (\code{NULL}) means retrieve \strong{all} years. NOTE: if you
happen to specify a 2-digit season value (i.e. \code{57} == 2017-2018)
the function is smart enough to retrieve by season ID vs convert that
to a year.}
